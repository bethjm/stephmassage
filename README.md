# stephmassage

I am building a website for a local business owner. I am in the beggining stages of the build right now. This is for me to track my progress and make commits on the days I'm praciting developer skills that aren't coding.

Juene 2nd-
I am starting to plan out the layout of steph's website. I started with looking through the reference websites she sent me and screen shotting the elements that she liked from them. I am pairing together all the pieces that she likes plus other provider websites that I have found to build the lay out. My progress so far is shown in screen shots in the June2 folder
