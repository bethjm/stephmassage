I am building a website for a local business owner. I am in the beggining stages of the build right now. This is for me to track my progress and make commits on the days I'm praciting developer skills that aren't coding.

June 1st-
I did research on where to host steph's website. I am trying to find a host that will allow for me to design custom elements for her and is easy for her to change/maintnain herself in the future. I think I have settled on sqaurespace. They use react and I can use plug ins for things like forms.

June 2nd-
I am starting to plan out the layout of steph's website. I started with looking through the reference websites she sent me and screen shotting the elements that she liked from them. I am pairing together all the pieces that she likes plus other provider websites that I have found to build the lay out. My progress so far is shown in screen shots in the June2 folder

June 5th-
Today I am finishing up the layout for stephs website. I will send her the results when I am finished and wait for approval. While I'm waiting for feedback I will research how to use squarespace developers.

Finished rough draft layout for website and sent over to steph for approval. Once she approves of the general layout I will put together a draft that is more cohesive with proper colors/text/etc

June 6th-
will follow up w steph today

June 7th-
Haven't heard back. Will follow up later today. Waiting on approval before moving forward.
